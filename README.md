In this repository, I am developing a collection of resources and implementations to strengthen and revisit my understanding of neural networks and their applications from first principles. My goal is to maintain a mathematically rigorous and computationally detailed approach, extending these concepts toward the analysis of diagnostic medical images and pattern recognition problems.
